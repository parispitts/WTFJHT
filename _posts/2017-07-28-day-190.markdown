1/ **Trump's hardball tactics backfired as the Senate rejected its slimmed-down Obamacare repeal with Collins, Murkowski, McCain all voting no**. The bill would have left 16 million more people uninsured by 2026 than Obamacare. Earlier in the week, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against the motion to proceed, causing Trump to attack Murkowski on Twitter, saying she "really let the Republicans, and our country, down." Then, before yesterday's vote, Trump had Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke call Murkowski and Alaska's other Republican senator, threatening that the administration may change its position on issues that affect the state in order to punish Murkowski. She didn't budge. Shortly after the vote failed 49-to-51, Trump took to Twitter: "3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"

A seven-year quest to undo the Affordable Care Act collapsed — at least for now — as John McCain kept his colleagues and the press corps in suspense over a little more than two hours late Thursday into early Friday.

2/ **A bipartisan group of roughly 40 House members have been exploring ways to stabilize Obamacare** over the past month. Efforts are expected to take on greater urgency after the collapse of the Senate’s Obamacare bill. Trump has threatened to cut off Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies as soon as next month, which could leave about 25,000 people in 38 states at risk of having no insurers willing to offer coverage next year.

3/ **Russia retaliated against Congress' new sanctions bill**, ordering the US to cut “hundreds” of personnel at its embassy and consulates in Russia. The Senate and House passed a bill that strengthens existing sanctions on Russia and gives Congress the power to block Trump from lifting them. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-28/russia-retaliates-for-u-s-sanctions-with-ouster-of-diplomats) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/world/europe/us-russia-sanctions.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/8801b4ad4f784490a1ea1ce6edfe7032/Russia-sanctions-bill-heads-to-Trump,-Moscow-retaliates))

* **Senate slapped new sanctions on Russia, putting Trump in corner**. The bill, which includes a provision that allows Congress to stop any effort by Trump to ease existing sanctions on Russia, will now be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-sanctions-idUSKBN1AC1U8))

4/ **North Korea fired another ballistic missile**. The missile launched Friday flew for about 45 minutes and landed off the Japanese coast in waters between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. It was not immediately clear if this was an intercontinental ballistic missile.
